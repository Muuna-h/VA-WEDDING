🎞️ Animation Sequence (Step-by-Step)
🎬 1. Entrance

    The envelope swings in gently from the top, as if gliding down the church aisle.

    It slightly tilts left and right, mimicking a gentle breeze or magical float.

    Framer Motion or GSAP can be used for easing and rotation.

🎼 2. Landing at the Altar

    The envelope lands gracefully at the center of the screen, as if it reached the altar.

    A subtle glow appears around it, indicating something special is about to happen.

    Optional: White flower petals or glitter lightly fall.

💥 3. Seal Pops & Envelope Opens

    The gold seal pops off with a tiny sparkle animation (scale+fade).

    Envelope flap lifts upwards, revealing a shining white paper inside.

✨ 4. Invitation Card Slides Out

    A folded card slides out of the envelope gently and unfolds with a bounce, revealing the invitation message:

        “You're invited to celebrate the union of Vanessa & Augustine…”

    Text appears with a fade-in + typewriter or letter-by-letter animation.

🎮 5. Transition to Site

    After 5–8 seconds (or on click), the card gently floats upward, revealing the rest of the page: RSVP, Event Details, etc.

    The music continues playing (toggle visible to mute/unmute).

🧩 Dev Notes (How to Build This)

    Use Framer Motion motion.div and variants for entrance, rotation, scale, and fade effects.

    Use absolute positioning to simulate floating movement.

    Add z-index layering for envelope flap, seal, and invitation card.

    Make sure animations are responsive (looks good on mobile and desktop).

🎁 Optional Enhancement

    Add confetti pop when the envelope opens for a joyful feel.

    Background can gently blur when the envelope is centered, focusing attention on the animation.
